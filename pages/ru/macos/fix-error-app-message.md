# Как исправить сообщение о поврежденном приложении в macOS Sierra или более поздней версии + Помощник

To resolve Gatekeeper issues on macOS Sierra and unlock images and programs ( annoying image/application is damaged messages pretending you cannot open things ).

For that reason you might have to completely disable Gatekeeper checks, and to do that open your terminal and type:

```
sudo spctl --master-disable
```

Your mac password will be required.

Or we recommend to use our Helper to do that for you, the helper offer the following options:

1. Disable Your GateKeeper.
1. Enable Your GateKeeper.
1. Allow Single App To ByPass The GateKeeper.

::: danger Note
TO OPEN THE HELPER FOR FIRST TIME RIGHT CLICK ON IT THEN CLICK OPEN

Off course we recommend choosing the option NO 3 which will keep your GateKeeper enabled but bypass it for a certain ( selected ) app/game.
